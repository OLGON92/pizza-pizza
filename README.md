## Test Driven Development Notes

_Describe: pizza()

_Test 1: "The function should return the size and toppings that were entered."_
_Code: console.log(pizzaTest)
_Expected Result: Pizza {size: 'Large', toppings: Array(2)}
size: "Medium"
toppings: (2) ['salami', 'onions']_

_Test 2: "It should change any number containing a 3 to the phrase "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
_Code: createArray("6")_
_Expected Result: ["0", "1", "2", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "4", "5", "6"]_
